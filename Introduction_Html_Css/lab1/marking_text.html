    <h1>Separation of concerns</h1>
    <p>In <a href="">computer science</a>, <strong>separation of concerns</strong> 
        is a <em>design principle</em> 
        for separating a computer program into distinct sections. 
        Each section addresses a separate concern, a set of information 
        that affects the code of a computer program. 
        A concern can be as general as "the details of the hardware for an application". 
        A program that embodies <abbr title="system on a chip">SoC</abbr> well is called a modular program. 
        Modularity, and hence separation of concerns, is achieved by 
        encapsulating information inside a section of code that has a well-defined interface. 
        Encapsulation is a means of information hiding.
        Layered designs in information systems are another embodiment 
        of separation of concerns (e.g., presentation layer, 
        business logic layer, data access layer, persistence layer).
